* About me/pre-preface
 - How to contact: emails (prefer personal over DHBW address).
 - Salutations: no Dr, prefer first name.
 - Academic background (+ teaching).
 - Will be happy to discuss other topics of interest *outside* lecture times.
 - Can speak German, prefer English since its more fluent.
 - Students are encouraged to ask questions without waiting for me to allow them - however, please be reasonable (e.g. don't interrupt in the middle of a sentence).
 - Also, please comment if you see any wrong arithmetics, I tend to do that.

* Mathematics
 - We'll have a lot of it, it's critical for this topic.
 - I will try to teach it in as much an intuitive and graphical way as I can.
 - Some background is expected: linear algebra, calculus, high-school level maths.
 - Are you familiar with Taylor series? Radians? (other bg maths will be added here later).

* And finally, actually introducing the topic.
